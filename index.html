                <p>This is not the aspirational fluff of Instagram wall neon; it's fact.  Recent surveys have shown that a
                    majority of travelers consider food first when planning a trip, even ahead of where they sleep. Add to
                    this that people are also traveling more than ever bwefore - earthlings logged a record-breaking 1.4
                    billion international trips last year - and it's safe to say that the hunger for new culinary experiences
                    is more ravenous than ever.
                </p>
                <p>While the endlessly alluring bistros of Paris, izakayos of Tokyo, shawarma stands of Tel Aviv, and
                    tasty menus of Mexico City will always top many people's lists of cravings, we're continually on the 
                    lookout for something new to fill our bellies, our passports, and our feeds.
